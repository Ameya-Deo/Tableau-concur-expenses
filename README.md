Data Visualization of Concur Expenses on Tableau.

## Introduction
Concur Expense is a cloud based expense management, including secure mobile access for your on the go employees, company card and electronic receipts integrations. Employees can create and submit all their expenses from their smartphones (or PCs, if they prefer), and managers can then reject or approve the claims also on the go. Your finance team can then perform a final review and process the expenses to be posted to your financial system (e.g. to SAP through the new direct integration) and paid, and even billed to customers based on project assignments.

## Purpose
I have visualized the data through different graphs for better understanding and creating dashboards for monitoring.

## DataSet
This dataset provides data on 49,975 records of the 215 employees of the company. One employee can have many entries.

## DataSet details
The dataset contains 13 columns: 
Employee
Employee ID
Entry City/Location
Expense Type
Organization ID
Organization Name
Department ID
Department Name
Payment Type
Sent for Payment Date
Transaction Date
Entry Approved Amount and
Vendor


## Conclusion
Analyzed the data and created various graphs such as bar charts, pie charts, bubble chart, time series map, employee detail sheet expenses based on location and pareto chart with the help of Tableau. Merged all the graphs and created 2 dashboards.
